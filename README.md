## Important Notes

> This is NOT intended to be used in production grade workflows. It's an advanced DEMO to showcase an interesting workflow driven by 3 microservices deployed on AWS Cloud.

## Manual Steps (only once)

- Deploy the [CloudFormation OIDC Template](.github/prerrequisites/github-actions-oidc-federation-and-role.yml), in order to correctly deploy CDK templates from the GitHub Action pipeline.
- Once deployed, proceed to add GitHub Actions Secrets:
  - DEV: `DEV_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `DEV_AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE`
  - PROD: `PROD_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` and `PROD_AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE`
- Configure META account and settings by following these steps:
  - [WhatsApp Configuration (once)](./docs/WHATSAPP_CONFIGURATION.md)
- Configure AWS Secrets by following these steps:
  - [AWS Secrets Configuration (once)](./docs/AWS_CONFIGURATION.md)
